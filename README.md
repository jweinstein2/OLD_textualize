# Textualize

Pulling out insights from message history.

### Prerequisites

This project only works for iOS devices. Android is unsupported.
Theoretically the analysis platform should be able to run on any OS. However,
the app has been tested only on MacOS. Certain features like the location of
the backup will require additional configuration.

### Dependencies

### Setup

1. Create an unencrypted backup of your iOS device. This allows access to the
   data in Messages and Contacts.
